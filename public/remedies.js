    description: "North American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius) has long been used for its medicinal properties. This herb has different effects from its Siberian and Asian cousins. American ginseng has been traditionally used for a wide variety of ailments. In addition to treating cold and flu, this form of ginseng is used in an effort to relieve stress, improve digestion, boost the immune system, enhance memory, battle HIV/AIDS and cancer, manage diabetes, and even prevent signs of aging. The root can be used to make powdered supplements or oils and extracts (which can be added to food or drinks).",
    reactions: "Unfortunately, ginseng can cause serious side effects and drug interactions in some people. Even with short-term use, ginseng may cause blood pressure changes, low blood sugar, diarrhea, itching, sleep problems, headaches, and nervousness. It can also cause vaginal bleeding, rashes, and allergic reactions."

    name: "Vitamin C",
    prevention: 2,
    treatment: 3,
    description: "Famous for its historic use to cure scurvy, vitamin C also has a long past in the prevention and treatment of the common cold. Vitamin C works as an antioxidant that helps body tissue grow and heal itself. It is a water-soluble vitamin that humans must get through food or supplements. Common foods that contain high amounts of vitamin C include bell peppers, citrus fruits, kiwifruit, broccoli, strawberries, and tomato juice (ODS, 2011). Vitamin C is also a common component of multivitamins and over-the-counter cold remedies. It is widely believed to improve general health, speed healing, and fight infection.",
    reactions: "Vitamin C is typically considered safe, even in sizeable doses. Side effects of vitamin C use by mouth are rare. They include nausea, vomiting, headache, cramps, and heartburn. Doses over 2000mg per day can cause kidney stones and diarrhea (NIH, 2011). In addition, people with heart conditions, cancer, diabetes, blood disorders, and kidney stones should always consult a physician before taking vitamin C supplements."

    name: "Zinc Lozenges",
    prevention: 1,
    treatment: 3,
    description: "Zinc has been used for decades to calm symptoms, reduce the duration of, and prevent the common cold. The human body uses zinc to support the health of the immune system and the eyes. It is also important for cell health, wound healing, and protein synthesis (ODS, 2011). Zinc can be found naturally in foods such as oysters, beef, beans, and oatmeal. It is also added to enriched grain products like bread and cereal. Only very small amounts of zinc are needed by the body to function properly. Severalmanufacturers sell zinc lozenges, oral sprays, and capsule supplements. Most zinc lozenges provide up to twice the recommended daily allowance of zinc for children and adults. Consuming a zinc lozenge every two hours when cold symptoms are present is unlikely to cause zinc overdose, however (NIH, 2011).",
    reactions: "Although studies have shown mixed results on the effectiveness of zinc, there is little controversy over its side effects. Zinc can cause metallic taste, local irritation, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and other problems. These side effects are more likely to occur with heavy or frequent zinc supplementation than from single lozenges. Overuse can cause coughing, fever, stomach pains, fatigue, and problems with blood iron levels. In large doses (10–30 gm.), zinc can be fatal (NIH, 2011)."

    name: "Chicken Soup",
    prevention: 0,
    treatment: 3,
    description: "Chicken soup has long been a comfort food for individuals with cold symptoms. Whether the remedy comes from the warmth and comfort of the soup or from actual cold-fighting ingredients in the meal, is still up for debate.",
    reactions: "Some people with food allergies or sensitivities to salt may experience negative side effects from chicken soup. Unstrained bones may also pose a choking risk, particularly for children. Otherwise, the potential benefits of chicken soup seem to far outweigh the possible risks."

    name: "Green Tea",
    prevention: 2,
    treatment: 2,
    description: "Green tea has been heralded for its ability to enhance alertness, fight blood pressure problems, speed weight loss, and perform many other medical feats. Despite limited research behind many of its health-related claims, green tea has long been used as a beverage and extract. Green tea (Camellia sinensis) and green tea extracts have been shown to possess potent compounds that can impact human health, such as antioxidants, polyphenols, and caffeine. Green tea extract is used in an ointment for genital warts, and its other (non-medication) applications include the prevention and treatment of dental, heart and circulatory, cancer, skin, and digestive problems (NIH, 2011).",
    reactions: "Temporary and long-term use of green tea as a beverage or supplement is likely safe for most adults. Some people may experience minor stomach upset or constipation from green tea use. Because of the caffeine and other active compounds in the tea, it may also cause more serious side effects in some people (NIH, 2011). Individuals who are pregnant, anemic, hypertensive, or diabetic should consult a health professional before using green tea as a beverage or supplement."

    name: "Lemon and Honey",
    prevention: 0,
    treatment: 2,
    description: "Lemon and honey have many natural properties that make them common sense cold fighters. Lemon is acclaimed for its vitamin C and antimicrobial properties (Dhanavade, Jalkute, Ghosh, & Sonawane, 2011; Efem & Iwara, 1992). Lemon may be used for its juice, peel, or extracted oil. Honey is treasured for its sweet taste, potential to fight seasonal allergies, and its broad range of antimicrobial properties. Together, they are often used in hot water or tea to aid cold symptoms. In addition, their flavors are a classic combination for throat lozenges.",
    reactions: "Wild honey may contain spores of Clostridium botulinum. When ingested by infants, these spores and their toxins can cause serious health problems and—if left untreated—death (NIH, 2011; Tanzi & Gabay, 2002). For this reason, children under 12 months of age should not be given honey. Large doses and extended use of lemon juice provide large amounts of citric acid, which may cause the erosion of tooth enamel, nausea or vomiting, and eye or skin irritation upon contact (ISU, 2000)."

    treatment: 1,
    description: "Whiskey and strong alcoholic beverages have long been used to fight infections and prohibit the growth of microorganisms (Ali, Dolan, Fendler, & Larson, 2001). Even today, it is used in antibacterial hand gels and mouthwashes to kill germs and prevent illness. Drinking a shot of whiskey or adding it (or bourbon, rum, or scotch) to a hot toddy recipe is frequently used to treat colds. Most hot toddy recipes include hot water, a shot of alcohol, fresh lemon, and a spoonful of honey.",
    reactions: "I mean, it's alcohol. Although if you're home sick on a Tuesday, you might as well be drunk too, right?"

    name: "Vitamin D and Sunlight",
    prevention: 3,
    treatment: 0,
    description: "Vitamin D can be found naturally in some seafood, but it is often added to fruit juices and grain products. Most people get the vast majority of their vitamin D from the sun, which helps the body produce its own. It is essential for bone health, and is also used to promote heart, circulatory, skin, lung, oral, muscle, and immune health (NIH, 2012). Many people do not have adequate levels of vitamin D in their systems, especially during the winter (Holick, 2006). Vitamin D deficiency can cause rickets and other health problems.",
    reactions: "Most people are not at risk of getting too much vitamin D. In high doses, however, vitamin D supplements can cause fatigue, weakness, nausea and vomiting, headache, metallic taste, and loss of appetite. Vitamin D supplementation can also have a negative interaction with certain medications for the heart, kidneys, blood pressure, and other health conditions (NIH, 2012). Always check with a physician before beginning vitamin D supplementation in combination with any other medication."

    name: "Eucalyptus/Menthol",
    prevention: 0,
    treatment: 0,
    description: "Camphor, eucalyptus, and menthol are often combined in ointments and medicines. Camphor is often used in topical pain relievers and muscle ache creams. Eucalyptus leaf or oil is used both as a food flavoring and in many medicinal applications. Eucalyptus is used to treat breathing problems, pain and inflammation, burns and ulcers, and even cancer. Menthol can be used as flavoring in lozenges for sore throats and coughs or as a soothing ingredient in anti-itch creams and medications for the mouth. The three are often combined in over-the-counter ointments used for nasal congestion and cough suppression (NIH, 2012).",
    reactions: "These three ingredients are not recommended for long-term use or excessive use during colds. Too much skin or oral exposure can cause camphor or menthol overdose or poisoning, especially in children (NIH, 2011; NIH, 2012). Eucalyptus can also cause negative side effects; it should not be used in combination with other herbal remedies and a large number of medications because of potentially toxic interactions (NIH, 2012). Eucalyptus may result in nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea in some people."
